In our application, we have two models: `User` and `Ticket`.

- `name`: (varchar(255), not null)
- `email`: (varchar(255), not null, unique)
- `role`: (enum, 'user', 'admin', 'superadmin', not null)
- `createdAt`: (datetime, not null)
- `updatedAt`: (datetime, not null)

**Ticket**

- `id`: (int(11), not null, auto-increment)
- `title`: (varchar(255), not null)
- `description`: (text, not null)
- `status`: (varchar(255), not null, default 'Open')
- `assignedTo`: (int(11), foreign key, references `id` in `User` model, default null)
- `createdAt`: (datetime, not null)
- `updatedAt`: (datetime, not null)
- `createdBy`: (int(11), foreign key, references `id` in `User` model, default null)

## API Requests

All requests to the API should be made with an HTTP client like curl, Postman, or any other client you prefer.

**Users**:

- Create a New User (POST /users)

This request must contain all the required fields of the User model except those that are auto-generated or have default values. Here is an example of a valid request body.

`POST http://localhost:3000/users`

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "role": "user"
}
```

- Get a List of All Users (GET /users)

This request does not require any parameters. Here is an example of how to make this request.

`GET http://localhost:3000/users`

- Get Details of a Specific User by ID (GET /users/:id)

This request requires the user ID in the URL path. For example, to get details of the user with ID 1.

`GET http://localhost:3000/users/1`

- Update User Details (PUT /users/:id)

The user ID should be provided in the URL path. The fields to be updated should be provided in the request body (At least one field must be present).

`PUT http://localhost:3000/users/1`

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

- Delete a User (DELETE /users/:id)

Replace :id with the ID of the user you want to delete.

`DELETE http://localhost:3000/users/1`

**Tickets**:

- Create a New Ticket (POST /tickets)

The request must contain all the required fields of the Ticket model except those that are auto-generated or have default values.

{
  "title": "This is a title.",
  "description": "This is a description.",
  "createdBy": 2,
  "assignedTo": 4

```

No request body is required for this endpoint.

`GET http://localhost:3000/tickets`

Replace :id with the ID of the ticket you want to get details of.

`GET http://localhost:3000/tickets/1`

## API Responses

Responses from the API come in the following format:

```json
{
  "isSuccess": true,
  "message": "Operation was successful.",
  "data": {...}
}
```

In cases where there is no data to return (e.g., deleting a ticket), the response will not contain the data field:

```json
{
  "isSuccess": true,
  "message": "Operation was successful."
}
```
